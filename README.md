# Personal Website

This is a small personal website built with plain HTML, CSS, and a tiny JavaScript file.

Structure:

- `index.html` — Home page with profile and links
- `about.html` — About / background
- `projects.html` — Projects list (includes Project 1 and Hour of Code example)
- `css/styles.css` — Shared styles
- `js/script.js` — Mobile nav toggle and small helpers
- `assets/images/` — placeholder SVG images

Next steps:

1. Replace placeholder images in `assets/images` with real photos/screenshots.
2. Update links to your real GitHub and Codecademy profiles in the footer and header.
3. Push this folder to a public GitHub repository and update the "View source" link in `index.html`.

To preview locally, open `index.html` in your browser.
