# AI Chat Usage

## Purpose
This file explains how AI tools were used during the development of this portfolio website.

## How AI was used
- Understanding HTML/CSS structure and template sections
- Fixing layout and styling issues
- Helping with Git/GitHub commands and debugging terminal errors
- Generating small text ideas (descriptions, sections)

## What I did myself
- Edited the HTML/CSS/JS files and made final decisions
- Customized content (name, links, sections, images)
- Pushed changes to GitHub and deployed with GitHub Pages

## Note
AI was used as an assistant for learning and troubleshooting. The final work and submission are mine.
